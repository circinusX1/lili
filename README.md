## LIGHTWEIGHT CAMERA MOTION DETECTION (Linux)
## SUITABLE FOR R-PI, NANO-Pi-NEO
## TIME LAPSE AND MOTION CAM 
## with network server, for webcast

#### Acceessible direct from browser http://IP:CAM_PORT
#### Acceessible direct from cloud server http://IP:SRV_PORT/?camera_name
#### Time lapse snapshots 
#### Motion Detection
#### Time lapse dark stop
#### Reject rectangle and inclusion rectange (2 rects)


Light weight camera designed to run on small ARM Linuxes. Plays animated jpg in the browser,
Captures images when senses motion, or at certain interval based on settings. 
### Demo:

--

### Build
    * Save this content in a file install.sh. 
    * chmod +x ./install.sh
    * ./install.sh
    * rm ./install.sh
--

```
#!/bin/bash
sudo adduser $USER video
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt install cmake build-essential
git clone https://github.com/circinusX1/lili
sudo apt-get install libv4l-dev
sudo apt install libjpeg-dev
sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev # (optional with code changes)
sudo apt-get install v4l-utils # (optional to adjust luminosity)
cd liveimage
rm bin
mkdir bin
cmake .
make
cp ./liveimage.konf bin
cp ./liveimage bin
echo "edit and configure liveimage.konf"
echo "Thx"
```


##### Camera as server 

Browse the konf file and make adjustments. Create the I{'save_loc'} location and give RW access for the user that runs liveimage

###### Tested on

  - HP x86_64 Linux with incorporated webcam
  - R-PI 3 with USB Camera
  - Nano Pi with USB camera and wifi USB dongle supporting AP
  - C.H.I.P with USB camera. The USB cable was changed to allow external power to USB camera due camera higher amperage
  
  
####  Direct Access:

```javascript
http://CAM_IP:9000    <-  shows the streams
# for mpeg encoding only the stream would work. This is experimental. For now user jpg format only
http://CAM_IP:9000/?html
http://CAM_IP:9000/?stream
http://CAM_IP:9000/?motion

```

##### Webcast mode. 
   * If is configured for motion & record @conf file and motion is detected it connects to server and start sending images at the rate of 'cast_fps' . 
      * The server would record these in 'records'@ conf. 
      * Upon  on_maxseq@conf would run the script. The provided script assembles the jpgs in a  mov file. 
         * For that you need on the server the ffmpeg.
   * The server link is: http:serverip:cliport/password  where the password is the configured password in config file.
   * That would show available camera streams. Like: http:serverip:8085/?frontcam
   * When the links is clicked the camera would detect that a user wants to look 
     * camera checks every 'pool_intl'@liveimage.konf) seconds for a server event. (like user wants to see)
     * Then start casting the images. 
     * As long the user looks at the cam or a motion is detected the images are also saved.
